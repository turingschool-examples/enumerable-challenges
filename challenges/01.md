Your boss walks up to your desk in a foul mood. "Just look at this array of email addresses."

"Some of the email addresses have capital letters in them! I need you to fix this." She hands you an array of email addresses and she'd like back an array of all-lowercase email addresses.

She gives you an hour because she thinks you're going to have to go through this by hand. Instead, you have a bright idea: you'll write some Ruby to solve this problem. Just make sure you write some tests as it would pretty embarrassing if your script had some bugs in it.
