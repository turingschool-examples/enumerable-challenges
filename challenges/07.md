Rhoda from shipping pops in with a package for you. It's those manilla folders you've been asking for.

"Hey, could I ask you a favor? We have a bunch of shipments downstairs. Ideally, we'd like to put the heaviest boxes at the bottom of the truck. Do you think you could write one of those fancy Ruby scripts of yours that would tell us what the heaviest box is?"

You reluctantly agree.
